## Origins

Most of this code was originally written as part of [hrdlr](https://github.com/twe4ked/hrdlr) at Railscamp by [@jasoncodes](https://github.com/jasoncodes), [@nathanaelkane](https://github.com/nathanaelkane), and [@twe4ked](https://github.com/twe4ked). It was then mostly copied into [snek](https://github.com/twe4ked/snek) by [@twe4ked](https://github.com/twe4ked) and then extracted into this gem.
